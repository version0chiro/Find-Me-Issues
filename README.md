## Trouble Shooting
If you encounter problems while installing npm, follow these guidelines to help resolve common problems: 

1. Verify your node.js installation
Make sure you have node.js installed in your system. Check your node version in your command line with this command: 

```node -v```
If the command outputs a version number, then you have node installed in your system. 

2. Clear npm cache
Sometimes issues can occur due to a corrupted npm cache. To clear the cache, run the following command:
```npm cache clean --force```

3. Consider Installing NVM if npm is not working properly. 
Run this script in your terminal
```curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.0/install.sh -o install_nvm.sh```

4. Check Proxy Settings:
If you are behind a proxy, ensure that your proxy settings are correctly configured for npm. You can set the proxy using the following commands:
```npm config set proxy http://<proxy_host>:<proxy_port>```
```npm config set https-proxy http://<proxy_host>:<proxy_port>```
Replace <proxy_host> and <proxy_port> with the appropriate values for your proxy.

5. Disable Antivirus or Firewall:
Sometimes, antivirus or firewall software can interfere with the npm installation. Temporarily disable your antivirus or firewall and try the npm installation again.

6.  Retry Installation:
If none of the above steps resolve the issue, try retrying the npm installation after some time. It's possible that the issue is temporary and could be resolved on its own.
